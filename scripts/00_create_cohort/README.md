### Inclusion

1.  ~~Individuals prescribed an opioid for pain in the period from the
    first MSK diagnosis to up to 3-months of continuous use in the
    future (gap of no more than 30 days, 7 days in sensitivity analysis)
    Call this the **exposure period.**~~

### Exposures

In the exposure period, define 2 variables: A1, A2

- ~~A1: MME (max)~~

- ~~A2: days supply (continuous use)~~

In addition, define multiple subsets e.g.:

1.  ~~B1 = A1 ≥ 50 MME~~
2.  ~~B2 = A2 \> 7 days~~
3.  ~~B3 = A1 ≥ 50 MME ∩ A2 \> 7 days~~

### Outcomes

Discretise follow up time in to 5, 3 month (91 days) intervals for a
total of 15 months (455 days) of follow up (starting after the exposure
period). At each point make a censoring variable and ~~OUD variable~~.
Individuals are censored when:

1)  ~~they turn 65~~

2)  ~~they become dual eligible~~

3)  ~~on December 31, 2019~~

4)  after 15 months of follow up
